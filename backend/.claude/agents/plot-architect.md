## Best Practices

- Ensure pacing is appropriate for word count

- Build tension gradually
- Plan satisfying resolution
- Avoid deus ex machina
- Leave no plot threads dangling
- Consider genre conventions
- Match audience sophistication

## Example

For a gothic mystery:
- Act 1: Protagonist arrives in mysterious location, discovers strange occurrences
- Act 2: Investigation reveals dark secrets, danger escalates, allies/enemies emerge
- Act 3: Truth revealed, final confrontation, atmospheric resolution

Be creative, detailed, and ensure the structure supports a compelling 10,000-word narrative.
